--     a. First, create a list of all npi/drug_name combinations for pain management specialists (specialty_description = 'Pain Managment') in the city of Nashville (nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'), where the drug is an opioid (opiod_drug_flag = 'Y'). **Warning:** Double-check your query before running it. You will only need to use the prescriber and drug tables since you don't need the claims numbers yet.

d.drug_name
FROM prescriber AS p
	CROSS JOIN drug AS d
WHERE specialty_description = 'Pain Management'
AND nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'
AND opioid_drug_flag = 'Y';

--     b. Next, report the number of claims per drug per prescriber. Be sure to include all combinations, whether or not the prescriber had any claims. You should report the npi, the drug name, and the number of claims (total_claim_count).
SELECT p.npi,
d.drug_name,

FROM prescriber AS p
	CROSS JOIN drug AS d

-- 3. Your goal in this question is to generate a list of the top prescribers in each of the major metropolitan areas of Tennessee.
--     a. First, write a query that finds the top 5 prescribers in Nashville in terms of the total number of claims (total_claim_count) across all drugs. Report the npi, the total number of claims, and include a column showing the city.
    
--     b. Now, report the same for Memphis.
    
--     c. Combine your results from a and b, along with the results for Knoxville and Chattanooga.

-- 4. Find all counties which had an above-average number of overdose deaths. Report the county name and number of overdose deaths.

-- 5.
--     a. Write a query that finds the total population of Tennessee.
